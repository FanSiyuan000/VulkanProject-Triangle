# VulkanProject-Triangle

Based on vs2022, Vulkan SDK Version1.2.198.1

Finished drawing a triangle.
Means the vulkan pipeline and command buffer was built.

Aim to build a basic vulkan engine, still many functions need to accomplish.

I try to use github as the code management tool, but I always make a mess, omg.
